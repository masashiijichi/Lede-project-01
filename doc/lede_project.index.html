                <p>According to Meiji Yasuda, a major Japanese life insurance company, Chinese characters used in names are becoming more complex. The number of strokes continues to increase, with the latest data showing an increase of 3.3 strokes to 14.4 for males compared to 1912, when statistics began.</p>

                <p>The rate of increase was greater for women, with the average number of strokes in 2023 at 18.3, more than doubling since 1912. In Japan at that time, Chinese characters were largely considered to be for men, and women's names were often written using characters called Katakana, which represent only sounds.</p>

            <h4>Names become more and more difficult to read  </h4>
            <p>As the number of strokes increased, the reading of names became more complex. One hundred years ago there was mostly only one reading for the most popular male name '清'. The reading was simply "Kiyoshi".</p>

            <ul>清 (Popular name from 1923)
                <li>1. Kiyoshi</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, some of the most popular names in 2023 have more than five readings. For '陽翔' in particular, it has as much as 10 different readings.</p>
            <ul>
                陽翔 (Popular name from 2023)
                <li>1. Haruto</li>
                <li>2. Hinato</li>
                <li>3. Hinata</li>
                <li>4. Hikaru</li>

                <li>8. Hyouga</li>
                <li>9. Hibito</li>

            <p>Name readings have increased dramatically since 2000 followed by the trend of increasing strokes. That was the year a famous Japanese celebrity Takuya Kimura named his daughter 心実 (Cocomi). The idea of having the original reading omitted or altered in part was new at the time.</p>
            <div class="png-container">

            <p><small>Cocomi (pictured right) posted an old photo on Instagram on her birthday taken with her father, Takuya Kimura (2020, @cocomi_553_official)</small></p>
            <p>That number peaked in 2015 when it recorded 5.9, but remains high.  In recent years, the increase in the number of complex names and how they are read has become a social issue.</p>

            <p>In Japanese workplaces and schools, after verbal self-introductions, people often have to ask how to write name in Chinese character.</p>
            <h4>The government recognized the challenges of not knowing how to read the names of its own citizens</h4>
            <p>All citizens are required to notify the municipality of their legal domicile within one year of the enactment of the law. The standard for reading characters different from those originally used in Chinese character will be established as "those generally accepted as the reading of characters used in names".</p>

            <p><small>Government document proposing a format for how to add readings to family registry information.  There is a note that points to the need for adding reading in the registry.</small></p>
            <p>The new system will not allow readings that (1) have the opposite meaning of the Chinese character, (2) are not clear whether or not they are misread, and (3) are not associated with the meaning or reading of the Chinese character.</p>
            <h4>Notify your reading, or they will decide how to call you</h4>
            <p>Currently, only passports, health insurance cards held by those who serve as employees in companies, and resident cards of some municipalities list the official name readings. Municipalities will notify citizens of the reading of their names already known on their resident cards etc. If no notification is received within one year, the reading will be listed at the discretion of the municipality, which is expected to cause confusion.  </p>

            <p>The data for popular names was obtained from the name ranking of Meiji Yasuda. The kanjiAPI was used to calculate the number of strokes for each name. GIF images of Chinese character and Katakana were obtained from the following websites, https://kakijun.jp/, https://www.writehiragana.de/katakana.html respectively, and the GIF images were partially edited for color and image assignment.</p>
